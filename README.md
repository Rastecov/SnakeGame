# SnakeGame
This project is a fully functional implementation of the classic Snake game, complete with graphical elements and enhanced gameplay features. The game challenges players to guide a snake that grows in length with each food item it consumes. The primary objective is to achieve the highest possible score without colliding with the snake’s body or (optionally) the board’s edges.
